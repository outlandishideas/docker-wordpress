# docker-wordpress
Docker image for Outlandish WordPress projects

## CI builds

We use GitHub Actions to build and push to Docker Hub daily and on changes to
the `main` branch.

See [the docs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images?version=v2.7.0)
for more on how and why CI and Dependabot are configured within `.github`.
